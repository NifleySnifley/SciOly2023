- Create a basic simulation GUI for testing drive controllers
 - Numerical integration 
- Path following (drive) controller!
- Starting configuration precision, sensor usage, laser guides
- IMU usage, sensor fusion for odometry, etc.
- Additional accuracy? sensors? vision for final target alignment (ESP-cam?)
