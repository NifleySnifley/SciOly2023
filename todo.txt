- Implement representation of paths (lookahead, position-at-t, etc.), options:
 - Bezier representation
 - Polyline (list of points)
- Create a basic simulation GUI for testing drive controllers
 - Numerical integration 
 - FMU (modelica)
 - Webots!
- Integrate pathfinding algorithm and create path from path!
- Path following (drive) controller!
- Starting configuration precision, sensor usage, laser guides
- IMU usage, sensor fusion for odometry, etc.
- Additional accuracy? sensors? vision for final target alignment (ESP-cam?)
